# Healthcare Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts cardiovascular disease risk based on patient health indicators. It's designed to demonstrate end-to-end data engineering and machine learning pipeline skills using real healthcare data.

## Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)  
- 70,000 patient records  
- Features include age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, lifestyle factors, and a binary target (`cardio`).

## Project Objectives

- Clean, process, and harmonize healthcare data
- Engineer relevant features (e.g., age in years, BMI)
- Build predictive models to classify cardiovascular disease risk
- Evaluate model performance and extract feature importance
- Prepare a machine learning ready dataset and visualize results
